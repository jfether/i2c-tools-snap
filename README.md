i2c-tools package for Snapcraft, description as posted at kernel.org below:

# I2C and SMBus user-space tools

This package contains an heterogeneous set of I2C tools for the Linux kernel
as well as an I2C library. The tools were originally part of the lm-sensors
project but were finally split into their own package for convenience. The
library is used by some of the tools, but can also be used by third-party
applications. The tools and library compile, run and have been tested on
GNU/Linux.
